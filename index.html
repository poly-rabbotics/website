                <p>Poly Rabbotics has had a great 2019 competition season and would like to once again thank all of their sponsors, family and friends for supporting the team.</p>
                <p>Team 7042 made it to the finals at the Los Angeles North Regional held in Valencia on March 14-17.</p>
                <p>Next, they reached quarterfinals at the very competitive Los Angeles Regional at the L.A. Convention Center on March 20-23. With just these successes, the team had blown by the goal of improving on their rookie season last year.</p>
                <p>The team was then selected to attend the FIRST Championship in Houston with just a week and a half notice and rallied together to send the robot and 22 students to Houston.  The team was placed in the highly competitive Newton Division and placed 14 out of 67 teams at the end of the qualifying matches.</p>
                <p>Even though the team didn't make the playoffs, everyone had an incredible experience and are excited to bring new ideas and enthusiasm to next year's competitions.</p>
